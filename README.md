# easycpp

This tool allows you to easily build your GDNative code directly from Godot.

The supported features are:
- Checking and setting up your build environment.
- Build using already existing SCons files.
- Supports Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 compilers for Windows.
- Supports GCC and Clang for Linux.
- Supports Xcode for macOS.
- Platforms and configurations can be freely defined in the project settings.
- Generate batch files to build your project.
- Create solution and build from Visual Studio.
- Create generic Qt Creator project.
- Update your gdnlib file.
- Create a new GDNative library.

This is the first version of the tool and I mainly focused on the actual build process, to make it for people as easy as possible.
